## What Does MagicZeroMirror Do?

At first the MagicZeroMirror Install Script will clone the most recent available RaspbMagicZeroMirror files. When this is done, the script will installs al dependencies prior to install the MagicMirror. Once all the dependencies are downloaded and installed, the script will clone the lastest MagicMirror repository (https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror). The installation will start. This can take up to an hour, depending on how many updates and upgrades need to be made to your Raspbian version. There is no interaction required.

(This is tested on Raspbian Buster with desktop | Version: September 2019 | Release date: 2019-09-26 | Kernel version: 4.19). You do not need the 'recommended software', but you do need the 'desktop'. Do not use the 'Lite' version.
